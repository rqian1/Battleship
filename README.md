# Battleship
Created a Battleship simulator as a class project and a computer strategy. Structure of classes were given (method names and intentions) but code was written by Rui Qian. Code not included is code not written by Rui Qian.
The Computer Strategy was entirely created by Rui Qian with no help in structure. Has an average of about 50.4 turns
